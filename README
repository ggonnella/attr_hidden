This is a Rails plugin, which was created for Rails 2.1
but might work also for other Rails versions.

It does not contain unit tests, so if you would like to 
collaborate, this would be a nice addition.

Although this plugin does not require STI, it is probably
only really useful with single table inheritance.

Example usage with STI
======================

Let's assume you have a table "entities" that was  
created by this code: 

  create_table :entities do |t|
    t.string :type
    t.string :title
    t.string :first_name
    t.string :last_name
    t.binary :logo
  end
 
The idea is that Person and Organisation will be
subclasses of Entity that use single table inheritance.

As in our example world people have no logo and 
organisations have no title, first name and last name, we 
want to hide this columns from their respective classes:

  class Entity < ActiveRecord::Base; end
  
  class Person
    attr_hidden :logo
  end

  class Organisation
    attr_hidden :title, :first_name, :last_name
  end

This is it. Person will have no logo anymore, Organisation
will have no title, first_name or last_name. Entity will 
of course retain all attributes. 

Now it's possible to hide further attributes in subclasses.
For example:

  class UntitledPerson
    attr_hidden :title
  end

UntitledPerson will have no logo (inherited from Person) 
and no title, while Person will still have a title.
